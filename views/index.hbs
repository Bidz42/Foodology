							<p class="lead">We started working together on the weekend over discord because zoom was being a ***** closing every 45 mins <br> We spent atleast 8 hours on Saturday and again on Sunday working together to build our app <br> We then branched off, me into the backend which was a pain in the a**, no pun intended, while Soufiane began on the frontend initially with CSS then giving up and focusing on bootstrap</p>

							<h3 class="card-title">Why?</h3>
							<p class="lead">It's simple really. We brainstormed what would be good to implement on our portfolios, as well as challenge us to make at the same time. We came up with around 15 ideas of apps to build but none sounded as appetizing as a database of FOOOOOOD. <br> And so we began taking this idea and laying out everything we wanted to do with it. <br> We started of by coming up with the routes. What links where and why it links. Then we started drawing up designs for what the pages should be like. This was probably the easiest part as our combined Paint skills provided us nursery level sketches to work with. For real though why is Paint so hard to work with. How does one draw a straight line? <br> The beginning was very smooth for us luckily allowing us to start our implementation of our ideas by Friday evening. This gave us a good head start so we could work on as many features as we wanted. </p>

						<div class="card-body text-dark">
							<h3 class="card-title">How?</h3>
							<p class="lead">As you probably know implementing logic into routes can be mind numbing. And so we started on the routes. One by one painstakingly we managed to implement them all. All but 2 :))) <br> In came Lloyd to the rescue after I spent 2 days trying to figure out this route and luckily we managed to sort it out. The logic was very intricate and really opened my eyes to just how much of a pain javascript can be. Shoutout to Jaime and Joshua too for helping with the final route with a simple .filter method which seemed to skip my mind even though we were dealing with an array. </p>

							<h3 class="card-title">What?</h3>
							<p class="lead">What was the point of all this? Well it certainly sharpened up our skills. this project was a perfect way of introducing us to the real world in a sense that teamwork makes the dreamwork. Trusting and relying on eachother is absolutely vital in building an app and we made it work very well :)</p>

							<h3 class="card-title py-2">Middleware</h3>
							<p class="card-text">So the problem was building a route to find a restaurant by ID, then show the reviews and other info depending on if you were the restaurant owner, review owner, logged in, and if you could edit reviews on page. The less said the better. </p>

							<p class="card-text">So from what I could hear Soufiane had one hell of a time with bootstrap. From the numerous hallelujahs when getting something to work to the far more numerous f***s every time something didnt work. My advice would be dont implement bootstrap from scratch. Learn about it first. </p>

							<p class="card-text">Bugs, Bugs and more Bugs. Honestly I would prefer my house having a cockroach infestation compared to the infestation of bugs when programming. <br> APIs, Routes, Middleware, CSS, SRC tags, A tags, HBS, JQuery you name it, its bugged. But with patience and logic anything can be solved as Ive learnt.   </p>
